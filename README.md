This project is a case study from my Object-Oriented Programming course. It is a console-based application that allows users to build their own computer by choosing between a Mac or a PC and selecting various components. The chosen configuration is displayed at the end. The project is implemented in C++ and its key features are the use of aggregation, composition and inheritance.
